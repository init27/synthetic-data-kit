  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document introduces MonkeyOCR, a novel document parsing model that leverages a Structure-Recognition-Relation (SRR) triplet paradigm to achieve state-of-the-art performance. MonkeyOCR simplifies traditional multi-tool pipelines and avoids the inefficiencies of processing full pages with large multimodal models. The model is supported by MonkeyDoc, a comprehensive dataset covering various document types in Chinese and English. MonkeyOCR outperforms existing open-source and closed-source models in English document parsing and achieves competitive performance in Chinese document parsing. The SRR paradigm enables accurate structural understanding, precise region-level recognition, and faithful logical ordering, making MonkeyOCR a promising foundation model for text domain applications.",

    {
      "question": "What is the main difference between pipeline-based and end-to-end approaches in document parsing?",
      "answer": "Pipeline-based approaches decompose the document parsing workflow into a sequence of specialized sub-tasks, while end-to-end approaches directly process entire document pages or substantial regions through a unified neural network, generating structured outputs in a single stage."
