This is a sample text file used for testing the Synthetic Data Kit.

It contains multiple paragraphs that can be used to test various functionalities
like text chunking, QA pair generation, and the overall workflow.

Synthetic data is artificially generated data that mimics real-world data.
It's useful for training machine learning models when real data is scarce,
sensitive, or difficult to obtain.

Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is a technique where language models explain
their reasoning process step by step before arriving at a final answer.
This approach often leads to more accurate and reliable results.

Fine-tuning language models on synthetic data can help them develop
specialized capabilities without requiring large amounts of real-world data.
