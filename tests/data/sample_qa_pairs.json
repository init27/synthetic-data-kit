  {
    "question": "What is chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning?",
    "answer": "Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is a technique where language models explain their reasoning process step by step before arriving at a final answer. This approach often leads to more accurate and reliable results."

  {
    "question": "Why is fine-tuning on synthetic data beneficial?",
    "answer": "Fine-tuning language models on synthetic data can help them develop specialized capabilities without requiring large amounts of real-world data."
